# GameTheory_Python
A repository of experiments and projects of game theory with python. At first, my goal is to upload notebooks showcasing how to represent the concepts and strategies covered in a graduate level Game Theory class. Ultimately, hopefully this will evolve to be a tool helpful for me, and other researchers, looking to explore game theory computationally.
